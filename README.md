# Smail!

It's email for people who like snail mail! Built exclusively for Salesloft users.

This is written in Vue 3 with Typescript and Tailwind. I tried to avoid using any component library as a lil challenge to myself.

To run this app locally:

1. clone this repository
2. install dependencies using yarn.
   1. if you don't have yarn installed, [follow these instructions.](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

```bash
yarn install
```

1. Spin up the local development server. This local dev server runs on Vite, which is the new hotness and is fast as heck!

```bash
yarn dev
```

Rock and Roll!

## Other Notes

If I did this again, I would've:
- written more tests
- componentized a bunch of stuff
- not spent so much time making the vuex store
- maybe used a component library... tailwind is great but chatty
